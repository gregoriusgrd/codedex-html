# Restaurant Menu üçΩÔ∏è
Welcome to my Restaurant Menu Project! This project is built with HTML and demonstrates the skills I learned throughout the course. It features a full restaurant menu page with a form for placing orders.

## Features
**1. HTML Structure**
- Properly structured HTML file starting with ```<!DOCTYPE html>```.
- A ```<title>``` element with the restaurant name inside the ```<head>``` element.

**2. Header Section**
- Image: An image with an ```id="header-img"```.
- Restaurant Name: A ```<h1>``` heading for the name.
- Navigation: Links for ```#menu``` and ```#order-form```.

**3. Main Section**

a. Menu Section:
- Three Menu Items: Each represented by an ```<article>``` element that includes:
 - An ```<img>``` image element.
 - A ```<h3>``` heading for the item name.
 - A ```<p>``` paragraph with a description and price (italicized).


b. Order Form Section:
- Form Inputs
 - Number inputs for menu item quantities (with a minimum of 0).
 - Radio/checkbox inputs for sides and add-ons.
 - A ```<textarea>``` for special requests.
 - A submit button with the text "Go To Checkout".
- Labels: Each input includes a ```<label>``` for accessibility.
  
**4. Footer**
- A ```<footer>``` that reads:
```Made with love by [Your Cod√©dex Username].```

## Example Output
**1. Menu Section**
- A visually appealing menu with images, names, descriptions, and prices.
  
**2. Order Form**
- User-friendly inputs for selecting quantities, sides, add-ons, and special requests.
